I removed this contenet as it was just a detaljed work diary day by day. A bit boring. 

But in shoort I aiamed for G level, as I had plans for the easter vacasion with friends and family. In stead I wanted to do the G level the best I could. Validations was what I used a lot of time on, trying to make it as user friendly as possible. 

My bigest problems was always in the repository part, with sql error... from typos and other stupied stuff

Prity ok with it now. Noticed som things that I could improve but all and all I think I did all that was requierd for G level.
