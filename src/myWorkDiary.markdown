Day 1: I read the G leavel of the exercise and out from that I decided that I will make 3 pakages.
        One package for all the classes related to Customers, one for Pruducts and one for Orders.
        Nils our teacher told: maybe good to devide it after simularitys in the classes. 
        I do not understand way, but maybe later I will realize and be ohh noo what have I done.

I started with the customers exercises. As all this was new. It was super hard and took me long time and
a lot of research and error search with ai to find my mistakes. If I just had waited one day to our class 
with Bill I would have got all this explained and done. But I did not know we would actually would do
the exercise that we had on our exam project I did it. Bill (tuesday lecture) we did the customer exercises
after I just finished them with a lot of sweat and tears...

Day 2: 
Started with the Product part of the exercise. Now it was a bit easier as I finally started to 
understand the core code that was needed and new. Now my biggest problem was the SQL errors that 
I am cursed with. The hardest was "Search for a product by a catogory id" I think it took me 2h to solve
the sql errors that keep happening, missing a , or speling mistakes and other stupied things.

Day 3. 
I started with the first exercise around 15.00 and finished 23.30, ok I had very long breaks 
feeling a bit unmotivated today. But very happy when I got it to work again.. the SQL errors was again
my problem. I also had to add new cunstructor with just the information I wanted to get out (what I had in my sql).
Took me proberbly 1 hour to understand that after sql error after error...
